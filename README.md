Once the modules above are installed, you can run the jupyter notebook or run the python script in the Spyder shell, or from the command line with the following command:

Note: If you go to contributers, it appears that user AddisonWood has to added any lines of code. This seems to be a bug with github, as he has actually added many lines of code.
